This is a very barebones library at the moment, only supporting basic
digital IO. It should eventually include support for all the peripheral
functions provided on the two BeagleBone expansion headers, so keep 
checking the github page for updates.  

To install PyBBIO:
 -Get the PyBBIO/ directory onto your BeagleBone, either using git clone,
  or simply by downloading it and scp-ing it.
 -cd into PyBBIO/ directory and run:
    # sh install.sh
 -cd into PyBBIO/examples and run:
    # python simple_test.py
  If all is well you should see two of the LEDs next to the Ethernet jack
  blinking back and forth for about 10 seconds.

The python-mmap module is required and was not installed on my BeagleBone,
despite it being part of the standard Python modules. 
It can easily be installed on the BeagleBone by running:
 # opkg update; opkg install python-mmap

I am using the same pin names as are assigned to the BeagleBone's two
female expansion headers in the schematic, which can be found here:
 http://beagleboard.org/hardware/design/

I am trying to emulate the Arduino API as much as possible.

Full API documentation found here:

Note: For any changes made to PyBBIO to take effect you must run intall.sh.


Hardware access is acheived using a memory map of the special file
/dev/mem, which is a map of the entire physical memory of the AM3358
ARM processor. 
The addresses of all the processor's memory registers as well as details
on how to properly use them can be found in the AM335x Technical Reference 
Manual (TI document spruh73c.pdf) which can be found here:
