# Create a BeagleBoard instance:
bb = BeagleBone()
# Set the two LEDs as outputs:
bb.pinMode('USR3', OUTPUT)
bb.pinMode('GPIO1_6', INPUT)

# Main loop:
while(1):
  state = bb.digitalRead('GPIO1_6')
  bb.digitalWrite('USR3', state)
  # It's good to put a bit of a delay in infinite loops 
  # to keep the CPU happy:
  time.sleep(0.1)
